# Crop Seed Estimation from Aerial Image Analysis (Mar 2025 â€“ Present)

This project focuses on estimating the number of crop seeds required for a field using aerial images. The goal is to develop an image-processing model that utilizes machine learning techniques to predict seed count based on the land area and soil characteristics.

## Features
- **Aerial Image Analysis**: Uses OpenCV-based image segmentation techniques to extract features from field images.
- **Seed Count Prediction**: Applies machine learning models to predict the number of seeds based on land area and other field characteristics.
- **Ongoing Improvements**: Experimenting with CNN-based feature extraction to improve model accuracy.

## Data
The data includes aerial images of fields with annotations for land area and soil characteristics. The target is to predict the number of crop seeds required for each field.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Scikit-Learn
- NumPy

## Installation
